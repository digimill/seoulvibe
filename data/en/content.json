In many apartment elevators, you still see F instead of 4. Even in high-end smart towers, this old linguistic taboo survives. Housing layouts are also distinctive: shoes-off entryways, floor-drain bathrooms, and wet-cleaning habits feel normal in Korea but surprisingly new to many visitors.",

      "core_idea": "Korea’s uniqueness often lives in operational habits. A restaurant can look empty while 30 teams wait in an app queue. Convenience stores function as neighborhood infrastructure for parcels, bills, lotteries, and more. Street trash bins are rare, yet recycling rules are granular. The visible layer and the system layer are both active at the same time.",
      "fun_fact": "Automatic doors in Korea are often very sensitive, opening earlier than many visitors expect.
